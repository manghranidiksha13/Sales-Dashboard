**Key metrics explained (so anyone understands)**

Units Sold: How many items moved — volume, not value.
Avg Order Value: Typical amount customers spend per transaction.

**Quick insights to look for**

High sales but low profit = pricing or cost issue.
High units, low profit = popular but low-margin product.
A small number of reps making most sales = replicate their approach.
One country dominating revenue = check scale vs margin.
